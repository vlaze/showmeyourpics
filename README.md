# Let the SHOW begin.

This script will help you browse your images in an easier way in your Maemo device. Sometimes we need to work in directories different than MyDocs, or feeling hacky and willing to see what does that .png in your `ls` prompt inside an application folder hide.

I have tried ImageMagick for this purpose, and although I think it's a really useful application for computers, I can't say the same when being used in my N900 little screen. 

That's why I started searching inside the Maemo community forums for a viable alternative, got a command line code snippet and adapted it to my necessities; open source in all its essence.  :water_buffalo: :penguin:

The usage is simple: you jsut need to put this file in /usr/bin, chmod it 755 and you're ready to go! Just type `show` + the image path you want to see (also works with whole directories) and the Maemo Image Gallery instance will appear just in front of you. Enjoy.
